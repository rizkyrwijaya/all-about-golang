In this folder, I am learning on how to start on with golang. The Hello.go file is a simple Hello World print as 
a standar in learning programming.

We create a package named main, and import a fmt module to use the println function.
Looking at the syntax I believe it has similarities to python where we dont need to use semi colons (;) as a line break.

When Importing an External Module, Go will automatically download the needed imports. To track dependencies it is also needed to run go mod init to create a go mod file which will have its dependencies and version listed.
