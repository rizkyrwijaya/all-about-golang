In this folder, I am learning on how to start on with golang. The Hello.go file is a simple Hello World print as 
a standar in learning programming.

We create a package named main, and import a fmt module to use the println function.
Looking at the syntax I believe it has similarities to python where we dont need to use semi colons (;) as a line break.
